## Kickstarter analysis
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this report is to define how Louise's play *fever* fared as well as how other plays compared. The kickstarter data that was received was full of many parent categories such as: "film&video", "games", "photography", "theater", and so much more. Since this spreadsheet had so much data, we decided to focus more detail in the "theater" category. To focus even more, we reduced the data down to the "plays" subcategory.
